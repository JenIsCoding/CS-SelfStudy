# INSERTION SORT ALGORITHM: More complex version

In this section, I implement a little more complex version of the basic *Insertion Sort* algorithm in order to sort a deck of mixed cards of different suits (clubs, diamonds, hearts, and spades).
*To be continued -- Add what the algorithm does in details.*
Currently (on 2024/10/07) I've uploaded the first version, but I need to streamline the syntax and add more comments to get a more readable code.

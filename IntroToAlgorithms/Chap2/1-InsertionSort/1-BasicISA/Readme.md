# INSERTION SORT ALGORITHM: Basic version

In this section, I am implement the *Insertion Sort* algorithm in order to sort a deck of unsorted cards of only diamonds.
I wrote the code in both C++ and PHP programming languages; you can find the codes in the `BasicISA.cpp` and `BasicISA.php` files, respectively. 
Then, I created a visualization to clarify how the algorithm operates; in the picture `BasicISA.jpg` you can see all the steps the algorithm needs to take to order the given card deck. For the sake of simplicity and to avoid making the picture too long, I chose four cards only to be sorted and get a more clear visualization.

# What is this repo for?

In this repo, I will upload all the files I will create for my "Computer Science" self study. 

# Programming languages and subjects 

I want to deepen the knowledge of the following programming languages:
- C++ 
- PHP
- JS & React
 
I'm also interested, depending on the topic, in going either into detail or in learning from the very beginning the fundamental algorithms (_Selection sort_, _Insertion sort_, _Merge sort_, etc.). After I have built a solid foundation, I will study the more difficult topics (probabilistic and approximate algorithms, trees and graphs algorithms for data structures, and so on).

# Book resourcesÂ 

At the moment, I'm studying from these resources:
- *Object-Oriented Programming Using C++* by Joyce Farrell (4th Edition);
- *Introduction To Algorithms* by Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest and Clifford Stein (4th Edition).
